You steel yourself for battle and draw your weapon. The dragon lets out a deafening roar as it charges towards you. You dodge its first attack, but it's clear that this is going to be a tough fight. The dragon is massive and powerful, and its fiery breath singes your clothes and hair.

You manage to land a few good hits on the dragon, but it retaliates with a swipe of its massive claws, leaving you wounded and bleeding. You're not sure how much longer you can hold out.

You have two options. You can either keep fighting, or retreat and come back later when you're better prepared.

Do you keep fighting the dragon, or retreat and come back later?
