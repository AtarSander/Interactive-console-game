You decide to keep fighting the troll, despite your wounds. You manage to dodge most of its attacks, and then you read the runes from ancient scroll you just bought from the wizard. A giant fireball emerges from withing you, hits the beast, which collapses to the ground, defeated.

As you catch your breath, you notice a glint of gold in the troll's lair. You investigate and discover a valuable gemstone, which you can add to your treasure trove.
