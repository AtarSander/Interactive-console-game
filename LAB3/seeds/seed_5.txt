You steel yourself for battle and draw your weapon. The troll lets out a deafening roar as it charges towards you. You dodge its first attack, but it's clear that this is going to be a tough fight. The troll is massive and powerful, and its fists fly over your head.

You manage to land a few good hits on the troll, but it retaliates with a swipe of its massive club, leaving you wounded and bleeding. You're not sure how much longer you can hold out.

You have two options. You can either keep fighting, or retreat and come back later when you're better prepared.

Do you keep fighting the troll, or retreat and come back later?
